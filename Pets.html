          <td>We absolutely adore Po. She first came to us this winter, and she would snuggle up in a blanket every day of her first week. She's a lot smaller than she looks under her bountiful fur. Try scritching under her ears, or rubbing her cheeks. Most of the time though, she's extremely shy around strangers.</td>

He's very well trained, and once you get to know him, he'll sit, shake hands, and when you say sick 'em, he'll slobber on the face of whoever you point at. Before you take this little guy home, make sure you're ready for like a million walks a day. And make sure to hide your treats; he'll steal anything he can see.</td>

They apparently grew accustomed to hands early on, because they love to be held, and to sniff around your face. Just don't interrupt them while they're eating, or they might nip you.</td>
